# Employee Paystubs
[Live Site](https://stevenmchoi.github.io/next_js/)

This is a web application that takes an employee's payment information on the
starting page and generates a table of employee paystubs.

This is part of a coding challenge that uses React, React Context API, and
NextJS.

## Input
* First Name (of employee)
* Last Name (of employee)
* Annual Salary (natural numbers)
* Super Rate (0% - 12% inclusive)
* Pay Period (month and year)

## Output
* Employee Name (full name)
* Pay Period (assumed to be start and end of month)
* Gross Income (monthly)
* Income Tax (based off of [ATO tax table](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Individual-income-tax-rates))
* Net Income (Gross Income - Income Tax)
* Super Amount (Gross Income * Super Rate)
